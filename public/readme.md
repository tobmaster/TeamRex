> Remaking the chrome offline dinosaur game

Note that this was previously written with p5.js but has since been refactored into a dependency-free approach. You can still see the old p5.js implementation in [the p5js branch](https://github.com/chrisdothtml/chrome-dino/tree/p5js).

## Run locally (literally)

I use [volta](https://volta.sh/) to automatically install/switch my node and yarn versions. Either install volta, or check the versions I'm using via the [package.json](package.json) `volta` field.

```bash
# install deps
$ yarn
# start server
$ yarn start
```
